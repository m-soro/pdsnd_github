### Description

This project computes descriptive statistics of three city bikeshare data. I used pandas and time modules in this project. Aside from satisfying the project rubric, I also added additional features in my project files.

Additional features are:

* Informs the user what filters are selected and how many rows of data are being aggregated on.
* Applies time filter based on the answers if month and day are selected.
* An option to view top 5 result for some of the aggregations.
* Two ways to view the data:
    * By every 5 rows
    * By specified amount of rows to return.
* Asks user if they want to see the data again.

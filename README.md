### Credits
 As per my bikeshare project documentation, I avoided looking at other student's bikeshare project because I wanted to write all of the scripts myself.

 Here are some references that helped me:

 1. Pandas official documentations
 2. Sites like [realpython](https://realpython.com/), [kite](https://www.kite.com/), and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
 3. Udacity's python lessons
